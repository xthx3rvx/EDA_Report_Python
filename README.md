# EDA_Report_Python

ðŸ”Ž Electric Car Data EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
This project provides a simple but powerful Python script for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on any structured dataset â€” with a focus on electric car data. It includes automated summary reporting and visualizations to help understand the structure, quality, and relationships in your data.

ðŸ“Œ Features
ðŸ“‹ Loads and inspects data using pandas

âœ… Prints an EDA report to the console:

Shape, data types, missing values, duplicates

Descriptive statistics

Correlation matrix

ðŸ“ˆ Generates plots and saves them automatically:

Histograms of all numeric features

Correlation heatmap

Boxplots for each numeric column

Add your dataset

file_path = r"your_dataset.csv"  # Replace with the path to your dataset

ðŸ“Š Output
All plots are saved in the plots/ directory:

histograms.png â€” Distribution of all numeric features

correlation_heatmap.png â€” Heatmap of feature correlations

boxplot_<feature>.png â€” Boxplots for each numeric column
